Currently have an api for calling buildings and adding type filters.

1. Attach covers
1. Finish any missing unit tests
1. Clean up any styles/interactions
1. Add transitions to add/remove of cards due to filter change?

## Boilerplate Info
This project is built on a boilerplate that I have developed and customized to my liking, which makes use of modern dev tools such as React, Redux, Sagas, Storybook, and much more.
